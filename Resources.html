    <h1>When you don’t have a first aid kit, you can use common household or natural items to handle injuries.<br>Here’s how:</h1>

    <h2>Cuts & Wounds</h2>
    <p>Resources: Clean cloth, water, honey/turmeric <br>Procedure:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Stop the bleeding – Press a clean cloth (shirt, handkerchief, or tissue) over the wound.</li>
        <li>Clean the wound – Rinse it with clean water. Avoid using dirty water to prevent infection.</li>
        <li>Apply a natural antiseptic – Dab a little honey or turmeric on the wound to prevent infection.</li>
        <li>Cover it – If possible, use another piece of clean fabric to wrap the wound.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Burns</h2>
    <p>Resources:Cold water, aloe vera, raw potato, honey <br>Procedure:</p>
    
    <ul>
        <li>Cool the burn – Pour cold water over the affected area for at least 10 minutes. If running water isn’t available, soak a cloth in cool water and place it over the burn.</li>
        <li>Soothe the skin – Apply aloe vera gel, raw potato slices, or honey to reduce pain and inflammation.</li>
        <li>Cover it lightly – Use a clean piece of cloth to protect the area from dirt and bacteria.</li>
    </ul>


    <h2>Sprains & Strains</h2>
    <p>Resources: Cold water, wet cloth, belt/scarf, rolled-up clothing <br>Procedure:</p>
    
    <ul>
        <li>Reduce swelling – Soak a cloth in cold water and wrap it around the affected area.</li>
        <li>Support the joint – Use a belt, scarf, or piece of cloth to wrap around the sprained limb for support.</li>
        <li>Elevate – Place a rolled-up jacket, pillow, or any soft object under the injured area to reduce swelling.</li>
        <li>Rest – Avoid moving the limb to allow healing.</li>

    <p>Resources: Tissue, clothing, cold bottle or wet cloth <br>Procedure:</p>
    
    <ul>

        <li>Pinch the nose – Use fingers and press the soft part of the nose for about 10 minutes.</li>
